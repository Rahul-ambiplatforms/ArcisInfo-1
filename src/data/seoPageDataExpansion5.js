      {"q": "Is ArcisAI truly Made in India?", "a": "Yes. ArcisAI products are designed and manufactured by Adiance Technologies in their own factory in India. The manufacturing includes PCB assembly on in-house SMT lines, camera assembly, integration, testing, and quality control â all under one roof. This is verifiable and distinct from brands that import Chinese products and relabel them."},
      {"q": "What is the difference between 'Made in India' and 'Assembled in India'?", "a": "Many CCTV brands import Chinese components (or complete products) and perform final assembly in India. ArcisAI's manufacturing starts at the PCB level with SMT assembly using non-Chinese SoCs, followed by complete camera assembly, testing, and validation in-house. This is genuine manufacturing, not assembly."},
      {"q": "Does Adiance offer OEM manufacturing?", "a": "Yes. Adiance Technologies offers OEM and ODM manufacturing services. System integrators and technology companies can partner with Adiance to produce white-label AI cameras and surveillance solutions under their own brand."},
      {"q": "Where is the ArcisAI factory located?", "a": "Adiance Technologies operates its manufacturing facility in India with state-of-the-art SMT lines and a vertically integrated production system for CCTV cameras, NVRs, and bridge devices."}
